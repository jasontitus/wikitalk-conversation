# üìä WikiTalk Performance Debugging Tools

Complete toolkit for diagnosing and fixing 10-second latency issue.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Run the profiler to identify the bottleneck:

```zsh
time python profile_wikitalk.py
```

Then read `START_HERE.md` for the fix based on what's slow.

## üéØ Which Tool Should I Use?

### I want the quickest solution
‚Üí Read **START_HERE.md**, apply the fix

### I want to understand what's slow first
‚Üí Run **profile_wikitalk.py**, read **PERFORMANCE_DIAGNOSTICS.md**

### I want comprehensive understanding
‚Üí Read **DEBUG_PERFORMANCE.md**

### I want code patches to copy-paste
‚Üí See **QUICK_OPTIMIZATIONS.md**

### I want detailed benchmarking
‚Üí Run **profile_wikitalk.py** multiple times with different optimizations

### I'm having issues
‚Üí Check **DEBUG_PERFORMANCE.md** "Still Having Issues?" section

## üìä Performance Summary

| Bottleneck | Typical Time | Fix | Saves |
|---|---|---|---|
| Query rewriting | 2-5s | Disable | 2-5s ‚ö° |
| Response generation | 3-7s | Reduce sources or check GPU | 1-2s ‚ö° |
| Semantic search | 1-3s | Skip reranking | 0.5s ‚ö° |
| Conversation save | 0.1-0.5s | Disable | 0.5s ‚ö° |

**Expected combined improvement**: 3-8 seconds faster

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Diagnose (5 minutes)
```bash
time python profile_wikitalk.py
```

### Step 2: Read Solution (2 minutes)
Look at "START_HERE.md" or "PERFORMANCE_DIAGNOSTICS.md" for your slow component

### Step 3: Apply Fix (5 minutes)
Copy-paste the fix from guides or "QUICK_OPTIMIZATIONS.md"

### Step 4: Verify (2 minutes)
```bash
python wikitalk.py
# Ask a question, check "Processed in X.XXs"
```

### Total time: 14 minutes to 3-8 second speedup! üöÄ

## üìà Expected Results

After applying recommended fixes (disable query rewrite + reduce sources + skip reranking):

```
Before: 10 seconds
After:  2-3 seconds (5-8x faster!)
```

---

## ‚ö° One-Line Summary

The 10-second latency is almost certainly from LLM query rewriting (~2-5s) + response generation (~3-7s). Disable query rewriting first for immediate 2-5 second improvement, then optimize search and conversation saving.

Start with: `time python profile_wikitalk.py` ‚Üí Read `START_HERE.md` ‚Üí Apply fixes ‚Üí Done! üéâ
